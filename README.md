# Logstasher

Logstasher provides logstash-friendly logging interface for Go.
It wraps any writer and writes logstash events to it.

This is how output lines look like:

```json
{"@timestamp":"2015-03-22T13:34:43.973174775Z","@version":1,"message":"hello","shards":[1,2,3],"tags":["wow","such"]}
```

## Usage

```go
f := map[string]interface{}{
    "app":    "myapp",
    "things": []string{"something", "another"},
}

w := logstasher.NewWriter(os.Stdout, f)

log.SetFlags(0)
log.SetOutput(w)

log.Println("hey, logstash!")
```

## CLI

Logstasher provides command `logstasher` that can be used in unix pipes.
It reads lines from stdin, turns them into json events and writes to stdout:

```
Î» echo reporting from $(hostname -s) | logstasher -fields '{"app":"myapp","pi":3.14}'
{"@timestamp":"2015-03-22T13:33:42.344282854Z","@version":1,"app":"myapp","message":"reporting from hyperion","pi":3.14}
```


You can also pass `-out` option with filename to write and `logstasher` would
happily write to that file, detecting log rotation and removal.

## Docker image

You can use minimal (8mb) docker image `bobrik/logstasher` to run logstasher:

```
# docker run --rm -it bobrik/logstasher -fields '{"from":"docker"}'
hey
{"@timestamp":"2015-03-23T15:48:02.543517666Z","@version":1,"from":"docker","message":"hey"}
```

or to install `logstasher` binary to your host:

```
# docker run --rm -v /usr/bin:/target bobrik/logstasher
installing logstaher in /target
# which logstasher
/usr/bin/logstasher
```
